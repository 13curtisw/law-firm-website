						<h3>Auto Accidents</h3>
						<p>Michigan is a “No-Fault” state, this means that if you are in an auto accident, drivers have
							insurance to cover their own injuries and damages regardless of who caused the accident. The
							Michigan No-Fault statute contains very complex language that may even seem foreign to the
							brightest of individuals. For this reason, it is critical that you consult with an attorney
							who not only specializes in No-Fault Law, but will also be there for you whenever you are in
							need of assistance.</p>
						</br>
						<p>
							Michigan no fault insurance will help cover allowable expenses, such as present and future
							medical expenses, work loss benefits and replacement services up to 3 years, and survivor’s
							loss benefits. These benefits are available to anyone who is covered by a no fault policy
							regardless of who was at fault for the crash. These cases tend to get complex, especially
							with the new reform.
						</p>
						</br>
						<p>
							On top of your first party PIP (personal injury protection) claim, you may even be entitled
							to bring a third party automobile negligence claim if you have suffered an injury that is
							considered an objective manifestation of important body function that affects your ability
							to lead your normal life, have a permanent serious scar from the accident, or led to a
							death. Issa Fawaz Law has a vast experience in dealing with insurance companies and we will
							not be intimidated or pushed to settle for less. If you are in need of an attorney that will
							fight for you, please contact us to schedule your free consultation.
						</p>
						</br>
						<p> As of June 11, 2019, Michigan enacted the new auto no-fault legislation. This legislation
							will completely change the field of no fault litigation as we know it. Stay tuned for
							updates. </p>

						<h3>Premises Liability</h3>
						<p>Premises liability is the responsibility or liability a land owner holds to ensure a vistor
							is not injured by the conditions of their property. It includes many different factors. For
							instance, a poorly lit or maintained property with tripping hazards such as broken steps,
							sidewalks, or other conditions that could lead to a slip and fall injury or even death.</p>
						</br>
						<p>Pet owners are also responsible for their pets and injuries they may cause to guests. Dog
							bites would be an example where a property owner may be liable.</p>
						</br>
						<p>Whether it’s a dog bite, slip and fall, or even a product liability case – give us a call and
							let us get you your just compensation. Contact us today for a free consultation.
